# Turbo-Ramjet-Simulator

Work in progress performance simulator for a first stage turbo-ramjet engine design similar to that of the Pratt and Whitney J58 engine of the SR-71. Performance for a 2 engine vehicle are simulated to investigate feasibility of reaching Mach 5+. Performance curves currently differ to that of colleagues, but still resemble the same trends. Convergence is achieved over 10x faster than colleagues.
